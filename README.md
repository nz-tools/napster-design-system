# Napster Design System — Unified Bundle

This folder is Napster's organization-level design system for Claude Design. Once published at `claude.ai/design`, every Claude Design project anyone at Napster creates will inherit it automatically.

## After import — start here

If you're importing this design system into Claude Design, read [**IMPORT-CHECKLIST.md**](IMPORT-CHECKLIST.md) first. Thirty-second post-import setup that resolves the four small things Claude Design doesn't auto-detect (fonts, full imagery library, AVIF, persona portraits).

If you're using this system inside a production app, read [**DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md**](DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) first. App teams should consume a pinned release tag, not float on `main`.

## What this bundle is

A synthesis of two source materials:

- **napster.com live audit** (April 2026) — the customer-facing truth.
- **AKEO Brand Re-Definition Proposal** (Mateo Reyes, 2026) — the structural framework.

Where the two agreed, that's what's here. Where they disagreed, the live site won.

## How to publish

1. Zip this entire `napster-design-system-unified/` folder.
2. Sign in to `claude.ai/design` as a Napster admin.
3. Upload the zip at the **organization level** (not project level).
4. Confirm publishing.

That's it. From that point, every Claude Design project anyone at Napster opens inherits this system as the default brand context.

## How to validate (after upload)

Run the five test prompts in `validation/test-prompts.md` inside Claude Design. Each should produce output that:
- Uses pure `#000000` backgrounds, Napster Pink `#DD52CB` on the load-bearing noun only.
- Sets headlines in Inter 700, sentence case, ending with a period.
- Uses the IBM Plex Mono 500 eyebrow at 12px uppercase, `+0.48px` tracking, color `#DD52CB`.
- Sets companion names and accent words in Instrument Serif italic where editorial gear is called for.
- Retrieves the right product imagery by filename (Station for Station prompts, View for View prompts).
- Honors the row-budget rule on fixed-height layouts.

If any of the five fails one of those, the bundle did not ingest correctly — re-publish.

## Where to start

| If you want to … | Read |
|---|---|
| Understand the system end-to-end | `DESIGN.md` |
| Integrate into a production app | `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` |
| Write copy that sounds Napster | `brand/voice-and-tone.md` |
| Pull tokens into code | `colors_and_type.css`, `tokens/theme.json`, `tokens/theme.ts`, or Tailwind adapters |
| Verify against the live site | `reference/napster-com-audit.md` |
| Build a slide deck | `DESIGN.md` + the tokens. Claude Design infers slide structure from the system. |
| Build a one-pager | `compositions/one-pagers/` |
| Find imagery — start here | `imagery/README.md` (slot vocabulary + asset map) |
| Find product imagery for Napster Station | `imagery/product/station/` |
| Find product imagery for Napster View | `imagery/product/view/` |

| Find a Companion environment scene ("where this role works") | `imagery/scenes/companion-environments/` (atmospheric, no person — for background plates and layered hero compositions) |
| Find a Music Producer portrait (Luna, Axel, Billie, …) | `imagery/people/producers/` |
| Find atmospheric / cinematic background | `imagery/scenes/twin/` or `imagery/decorative/` |

## Non-negotiable rules

These rules override everything else, including style intuition.

1. Pure `#000000` backgrounds for marketing, decks, one-pagers, and brand surfaces. Product/app surfaces may opt into light with `data-theme="light"`.
2. Napster Pink `#DD52CB` on the load-bearing noun only. On light app surfaces, use pink-deep `#BE369D` for small text accents.
3. Eyebrows are IBM Plex Mono 500, 12px, uppercase, `+0.48px` tracking, and `var(--eyebrow-fg)`. Every section gets one.
4. Hero headlines are Inter 700, sentence case, ending with a period.
5. Companion names and accent words use Instrument Serif italic. Pull quotes, the same.
6. Metadata (page numbers, timestamps, footer markers, slide chrome) sits in IBM Plex Mono.
7. Wordmark top-left, clearspace ≥ logo-height.
8. Banned words: *revolutionize, disrupt, leverage, solution, seamlessly, effortlessly, powerful, unlock, empower, industry-leading, world-class, chatbot, assistant, bot, users, AI-powered, game-changing.*
9. Round every corner you can. The circle is the visual backbone.
10. Companions have full human names. Never "the AI".
11. No emoji. Anywhere.
12. Fixed-size layouts declare a row budget and re-total when any band grows.

## Version

`v1.3.2` — Color Modes specimen + Poppins decision doc. Adds `components/components-color-modes.html` (dark + light side-by-side) so Claude Design's curator has a card-shaped preview of the dual-mode story to surface. Documents in `DESIGN.md` §3 why Poppins (AKEO's Google Fonts alternative to Avantt) was not carried into the post-v1.1.0 system. Doc/specimen-only patch; no token or CSS changes.

Previous: `v1.3.1` — light cascade discoverability fix. Moves the runtime light app-surface cascade into `colors_and_type.css` so one canonical import covers both modes and fresh Claude Design imports see light-mode support; keeps `tokens/theme-light.css` as a one-release back-compat stub.

Previous: `v1.3.0` — light mode for product/app surfaces. Adds role-token theming, `tokens/theme-light.css`, DTCG light peers, Tailwind `light:` adapters, mode-aware `theme.json` / `theme.ts`, side-by-side mode specimen, admin UI recipes, and executable theme validation.

Previous: `v1.2.4` — component specimen audit. Surfaces `.btn-primary-pulse` and `:focus-visible`, and normalizes eyebrow drift to the canonical `.eyebrow` class.

Previous: `v1.2.0` — developer-experience cut. Adds Tailwind v4/v3 adapters, `theme.json` / `theme.ts`, DTCG component state tokens, a production app integration guide, a canonical component reference, asset URL override hooks, and expanded accessibility guidance.

Previous: `v1.1.1` — hygiene patch. Adds missing focus-visible states, reconciles component specimens with canonical radii/focus treatment, fixes the Napster App prototype's Amit portrait and eyebrow tokens, and corrects the WCAG contrast notes.

Previous: `v1.1.0` — three-font system. Avantt retired from the design system; Inter (display + body), Instrument Serif italic (editorial accents), and IBM Plex Mono (metadata) now carry everything. The live napster.com site continues to use Avantt and is documented as such in `reference/napster-com-audit.md`.

Previous: `v1.0.14` — final Avantt-based release. Self-hosted Avantt across all four weights, jsDelivr CDN delivery, font-registry upload required at import time.
